“Are you here to experience life or to think about it?”
“Confidence without clarity is always a disaster.”
“Nothing in life is a problem – everything is a possibility.”
“The mind remembers only certain things. The body remembers everything. The information it carries goes back to the beginning of existence.”
“The most beautiful moments in life are moments when you are expressing your joy, not when you are seeking it.”
