Realize deeply that the present moment is all you have. Make the NOW the primary focus of your life.
Life isn't as serious as the mind makes it out to be.
The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation but your thoughts about it.
The power for creating a better future is contained in the present moment: You create a good future by creating a good present.
Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it.
Worry pretends to be necessary but serves no useful purpose.
Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have. There is never a time when your life is not 'this moment'.
Nothing ever happened in the past; it happened in the Now. Nothing will ever happen in the future; it will happen in the Now.
The more you live in the present moment, the more the fear of death disappears.
You do not become good by trying to be good, but by finding the goodness that is already within you.
Life will give you whatever experience is most helpful for the evolution of your consciousness.
The moment you become aware of the ego in you, it is strictly speaking no longer the ego, but just an old, conditioned mind-pattern.
The past cannot survive in your presence. It can only survive in your absence.
To be free of time is to be free of the psychological need of past for your identity and future for your fulfillment.
When you complain, you make yourself a victim. Leave the situation, change the situation, or accept it. All else is madness.
The more you are focused on time—past and future—the more you miss the Now, the most precious thing there is.
You are the sky. The clouds are what happens, what comes and goes.
If not now, when?
The more you make your thoughts (beliefs and opinions) into your identity, the more cut off you are from the spiritual dimension within yourself.
Anything that you resent and strongly react to in another is also in you.
When you lose touch with inner stillness, you lose touch with yourself. When you lose touch with yourself, you lose yourself in the world.
Wherever you are, be there totally.
The present moment is the field on which the game of life happens.
To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and lightness.
The beginning of freedom is the realization that you are not the thinker. The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated.
Most humans are never fully present in the now because unconsciously they believe that the next moment must be more important than this one. But then you miss your whole life, which is never not now.
The joy of Being, which is the only true happiness, cannot come to you through any form, possession, achievement, person, or event—through anything that happens.
You are the universe expressing itself as a human for a little while.
Time isn't precious at all, because it is an illusion. What you perceive as precious is not time but the one point that is out of time: the Now.
Whatever you fight, you strengthen, and what you resist, persists.
Being must be felt. It can't be thought.
The ego says, 'I shouldn't have to suffer,' and that thought makes you suffer so much more. It is a distortion of the truth, which is always paradoxical.
In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form.
Your outer journey may contain a million steps; your inner journey only has one: the step you are taking right now.
Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance.
Don't seek happiness. If you seek it, you won't find it because seeking is the antithesis of happiness.
Your task is not to search for love but to find a portal through which love can enter.
If there were nothing but thought in you, you wouldn't even know you are thinking. You would be like a dreamer who doesn't know he is dreaming.
Being spiritual has nothing to do with what you believe and everything to do with your state of consciousness.
Accept, then act. Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it.
All the things that truly matter—beauty, love, creativity, joy, inner peace—arise from beyond the mind.
What a liberation to realize that the 'voice in my head' is not who I am. Who am I then? The one who sees that.
Do not be concerned with the fruit of your action—just give attention to the action itself.
Don't look for peace. Don't look for any other state than the one you are in now; otherwise, you will set up inner conflict and unconscious resistance.
All true artists, whether they know it or not, create from a place of no-mind, from inner stillness.
Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you are withholding from the world.
Unease, anxiety, tension, stress, worry—all forms of fear—are caused by too much future and not enough presence.
Love is a state of Being. Your love is not outside; it is deep within you.
The moment you accept what troubles you've been given, the door will open.
When you don't cover up the world with words and labels, a sense of the miraculous returns to your life.
Life is an adventure, it's not a package tour.
The past gives you an identity and the future holds the promise of salvation, of fulfillment in whatever form. Both are illusions.
The mind exists in a state of 'not enough' and so is always greedy for more. When you are identified with mind, you get bored and restless very easily.
The power of Now can only be realized through the cessation of thinking.
To be aware of little, quiet things, you need to be quiet inside. A high degree of alertness is required.
Nothing ever happened in the past that can prevent you from being present now.
The primary cause of unhappiness is never the situation, but your thoughts about it.
The moment you start watching the thinker, a higher level of consciousness becomes activated.
You find peace not by rearranging the circumstances of your life, but by realizing who you are at the deepest level.
The power is in you. The answer is in you. And you are the answer to all your searches: you are the goal. You are the answer. It's never outside.
The greatest catalyst for change in a relationship is complete acceptance of your partner as he or she is, without needing to judge or change them in any way.
You are the timeless and formless being, which simply witnesses everything, including the arising and passing of thoughts.
Don't be concerned with what other people think of you. You are not responsible for their opinions. You are responsible for your own happiness.
Stop trying to impress others and start living your life authentically. When you are true to yourself, you inspire others to do the same.
Let go of the need to control outcomes. Trust in the unfolding of life and allow yourself to flow with it.
Your true nature is pure consciousness. Rest in this awareness and all illusions will dissolve.
You are not your thoughts. You are the awareness behind them. Watch them come and go like clouds in the sky.
The mind creates the illusion of problems. Let go of the mind and you will see that there are no problems, only situations to be faced.

The most important aspect of love is not in giving or the receiving: it’s in the being.
We're all just walking each other home.
The heart surrenders everything to the moment. The mind judges and holds back.
You are loved just for being who you are, just for existing.
The spiritual journey is individual, highly personal. It can't be organized or regulated. It isn't true that everyone should follow one path. Listen to your own truth.
Treat everyone you meet like God in drag.
The game is not about becoming somebody; it's about becoming nobody.
Suffering is part of our training program for becoming wise.
The spiritual life does not remove us from the world but leads us deeper into it.
Your problem is you're too busy holding onto your unworthiness.
The most exquisite paradox: as soon as you give it all up, you can have it all. As long as you want power, you can't have it. The minute you don't want power, you'll have more than you ever dreamed possible.
You don't have to be a passive recipient of whatever karmic flow comes your way; you can consciously choose to accelerate and intensify the quality of your own evolution.

Unconditional love really exists in each of us. It is part of our deep inner being. It is not so much an active emotion as a state of being. It's not 'I love you' for this or that reason, not 'I love you if you love me.' It's love for no reason, love without an object.
When you go out into the woods, and you look at trees, you see all these different trees. And some of them are bent, and some of them are straight, and some of them are evergreens, and some of them are whatever. And you look at the tree and you allow it. You see why it is the way it is. You sort of understand that it didn’t get enough light, and so it turned that way. And you don’t get all emotional about it. You just allow it. You appreciate the tree. The minute you get near humans, you lose all that. And you are constantly saying ‘You’re too this, or I’m too this.’ That judgment mind comes in. And so I practice turning people into trees. Which means appreciating them just the way they are.
You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop.
When the faith is strong enough, it is sufficient just to be. It's a journey towards simplicity, towards quietness, towards a kind of joy that is not in time. It's a journey that has taken us from primary identification with our body and our psyche, on to an identification with God, and ultimately beyond identification.
You are awareness. It is that simple. You are awareness. Awareness is another name for you.
To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest.
I would say that the thrust of my life has been initially about getting free, and then realizing that my freedom is not independent of everybody else. Then I am arriving at that circle where one works on oneself as a gift to other people so that one doesn't create more suffering.
Our interactions with one another reflect a dance between love and fear.
The more you rely on the outside world as a guide for what's going on inside you, the more lost you're going to get.

You may be an expert in the relative, but I am an expert in the absolute.
The ego is an exquisite instrument. Enjoy it, use it – just don't get lost in it.
You are not a human being having a spiritual experience; you are a spiritual being having a human experience.
The resistance to the unpleasant situation is the root of suffering.
The path of love is not about changing the world; it's about changing yourself.
When you meet anyone, remember it is a holy encounter. As you see him, you will see yourself. As you treat him, you will treat yourself. As you think of him, you will think of yourself. Never forget this, for in him you will find yourself or lose yourself.
In most of our human relationships, we spend much of our time reassuring one another that our costumes of identity are on straight.
If you think you're enlightened, go spend a week with your family.
It is important to expect nothing, to take every experience, including the negative ones, as merely steps on the path, and to proceed.
Treat everyone you meet as if they are God in drag.
Spiritual practice is just training wheels for the mind.
You may go through life missing half of what's actually going on, because you're only seeing it through one eye.
In our relationships, how much can we allow the other person to be whoever they are?

The game is not about becoming somebody, it's about becoming nobody.
In the process of letting go, you will lose many things from the past, but you will find yourself.
It is only when we have the courage to face things exactly as they are, without any self-deception or illusion, that a light will develop out of events by which the path to success may be recognized.
If you want to be a true human being, you have to learn to love yourself and others.
Remember, we are all affecting the world every moment, whether we mean to or not. Our actions and states of mind matter, because we're so deeply interconnected with one another.
Everything changes once we identify with being the witness to the story, instead of the actor in it.
You can only lose what you cling to.
The moment you accept what troubles you've been given, the door will open.
The spiritual journey is one of constant transformation. In this process, you will encounter many deaths and rebirths.
We are all affecting the world every moment, whether we mean to or not. Our actions and states of mind matter, because we're so deeply interconnected with one another.
There is just no inherent satisfaction in egoic desires. They never bring the happiness we seek.
The question we need to ask ourselves is whether there is any place we can stand in ourselves, where we can look at all that's happening around us without freaking out, where we can be quiet enough to hear our predicament, and where we can begin to find ways of acting that are at least not contributing to further destabilization.
It's important to be here, and you can't do that with a lot of things on your mind.
The mind can go in a thousand directions, but on this beautiful path, I walk in peace. With each step, the wind blows. With each step, a flower blooms.
You can't cling to the past or to the moment either. They're both gone. But you can cling, which means you're attached to something that's already gone.
