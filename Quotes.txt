Your whole idea about yourself is borrowed - borrowed from those who have no idea of who they are themselves.
The less people know, the more stubbornly they know it.
Be less of a judge and you will be surprised that when you become a witness and you don't judge yourself, you stop judging others too. And that makes you more human, more compassionate, more understanding.
Love is not a relationship, love is a state of being; it has nothing to do with anybody else. One is not 'in love', one is love.
Life begins where fear ends.
Don't compare yourself with anyone else. You are unique, incomparable. You are yourself, you are simply yourself. Don't be worried about what others are doing, whether they are succeeding or failing. You don't know their inner story; you don't know their whole story.
When you love, love as if the person is a god, not less than that. Never love a woman as a woman and never love a man as a man.
If you suffer it is because of you, if you feel blissful it is because of you. Nobody else is responsible, only you and you alone. You are your hell and your heaven too.
If you love yourself, you love others. If you hate yourself, you hate others. Because in relationship with others, the other is nothing but a mirror.
Friendship is the purest love. It is the highest form of Love where nothing is asked for, no condition, where one simply enjoys giving.
Only laughter makes a man rich, but the laughter has to be blissful.
The greatest fear in the world is the opinion of others, and the moment you are unafraid of the crowd, you are no longer a sheep, you become a lion. A great roar arises in your heart, the roar of freedom.
Don't seek, don't search, don't ask, don't knock, don't demand - relax. If you relax, it comes. If you relax, it is there. If you relax, you start vibrating with it.
Creativity is the greatest rebellion in existence.
Experience life in all possible ways - good, bad, bitter, sweet, dark, light, summer, winter. Experience all the dualities. Don't be afraid of experience, because the more experience you have, the more mature you become.
To be alone is the only real revolution. To accept that you are alone is the greatest transformation that can happen to you.
The capacity to be alone is the capacity to love. It may look paradoxical to you, but it's not. It is an existential truth: only those people who are capable of being alone are capable of love, of sharing, of going into the deepest core of the other person - without possessing the other, without becoming dependent on the other, without reducing the other to a thing, and without becoming addicted to the other.
Truth is not something outside to be discovered, it is something inside to be realized.
Be realistic: Plan for a miracle.
The moment a child is born, the mother is also born. She never existed before. The woman existed, but the mother, never. A mother is something absolutely new.
Don't be attached to the outcome, just give your best and let life unfold as it may.
Your whole idea about yourself is borrowed - borrowed from those who have no idea of who they are themselves.
Drop the idea of becoming someone, because you are already a masterpiece. You cannot be improved. You have only to come to it, to know it, to realize it.
Falling in love you remain a child; rising in love you mature. By and by love becomes not a relationship, it becomes a state of your being. Not that you are in love - now you are love.
Friendship is the purest love. It is the highest form of Love where nothing is asked for, no condition, where one simply enjoys giving.
Life begins where fear ends.

Love is not a relationship, love is a state of being; it has nothing to do with anybody else. One is not 'in love', one is love.
If you love a flower, don't pick it up. Because if you pick it up, it dies, and it ceases to be what you love. So if you love a flower, let it be. Love is not about possession. Love is about appreciation.
In a single moment, the whole existence converges in you. You become the center of the cyclone.
Friendship is the purest love. It is the highest form of Love where nothing is asked for, no condition.
Nobody has the power to take two steps together; you can take only one step at a time.
Courage is a love affair with the unknown.
To be creative means to be in love with life. You can be creative only if you love life enough that you want to enhance its beauty, you want to bring a little more music to it, a little more poetry to it, a little more dance to it.
Don't seek, don't search, don't ask, don't knock, don't demand - relax. If you relax, it comes. If you relax, it is there. If you relax, you start vibrating with it.

Your whole idea about yourself is borrowed - borrowed from those who have no idea of who they are themselves.
The mind is always ready to go on a trip because it is a trip; it is a constant trip from the past to the future.
In deep meditation, a sexual orgasm happens - not with someone outside you, but with your own polar opposite within. Your inner man and your inner woman meet and merge into each other.
The real question is not whether life exists after death. The real question is whether you are alive before death.
Sadness gives depth. Happiness gives height. Sadness gives roots. Happiness gives branches. Happiness is like a tree going into the sky, and sadness is like the roots going down into the womb of the earth.
Friendship is the purest love. It is the highest form of Love where nothing is asked for, no condition, where one simply enjoys giving.
Listen to your being. It is continuously giving you hints; it is a still, small voice. It does not shout at you, that is true. And if you are a little silent you will start feeling your way. Be the person you are. Never try to be another, and you will become mature. Maturity is accepting the responsibility of being oneself, whatsoever the cost. Risking all to be oneself, that's what maturity is all about.
Don't try to understand life. Live it! Don't try to understand love. Move into love. Then you will know - and all that knowing will come out of your experiencing. The more you know, the more you know that much remains to be known.
If you love a flower, don't pick it up. Because if you pick it up, it dies, and it ceases to be what you love. So if you love a flower, let it be. Love is not about possession. Love is about appreciation.
When I say 'be creative,' I don't mean that you should all go and become great painters and great poets. I simply mean let your life be a painting, let your life be a poem.
Drop the idea of becoming someone, because you are already a masterpiece. You cannot be improved. You have only to come to it, to know it, to realize it.
Only laughter makes a man rich, but the laughter has to be blissful.

Love and respect yourself and never compromise for anything. And then you will be surprised how much growth starts happening of its own accord.
The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook.
Don't be afraid of experience, because the more experience you have, the more mature you become.
Be less of a judge and you will be surprised that when you become a witness and you don't judge yourself, you stop judging others too. And that makes you more human, more compassionate, more understanding.
